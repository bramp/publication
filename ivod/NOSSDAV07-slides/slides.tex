    \textbf{Characterising User Interactivity for Sports Video-on-Demand}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Created a simple Video-on-Demand service offered to university staff and students~\\

        \item Served interactive sport videos (specifically 2006 FIFA World Cup)~\\

        \item Obtained traces and characterised the interactive user behaviour~\\

        \item Interactivity has an dramatic impact~\\
        \item Discuss how Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) can exploit this behaviour~\\

%    \center{\it\small
%        This paper presents a \textbf{detailed characterisation} of user behaviour
%        for a series of \textbf{interactive sport videos} from the 2006 \textbf{FIFA World
%        Cup}. In addition to generic VCR-like features, our custom-built
%        \textbf{Video-on-Demand} architecture enabled us to provide advanced
%        interactivity features such as \textbf{bookmarking}. We illustrate how such
%        functionality may have a dramatic impact on how users consume
%        content. A detailed \textbf{discussion} is also provided on how \textbf{content
%        distributors} may turn this knowledge to their advantage, and thus
%        \textbf{increase} the \textbf{efficiency} of their \textbf{delivery networks}.

\subsection{Motivation}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Motivation 1}
    % Reading out and expanding what's listed on the slide :)

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Increase in the use of \textbf{bandwidth intense streaming} videos~\\~\\
        \item Users expect \textbf{more interactivity} (VCR, Bookmarks, Time-shifting)~\\~\\

        \item Content Distribution Networks are used to alleviate these problems
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Need to know workloads} to exploit behaviour (caching, replication, streaming protocols)
        \end{itemize}~\\

    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Motivation 2}
    % Reading out and expanding what's listed on the slide :)

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Traditional workloads are \textbf{not very interactive}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Simple start-to-finish models
            \item Only minimal VCR interactivity
            \item \textbf{Never considered bookmarks}
        \end{itemize}~\\

        \item Large traces are private~\\~\\
        \item Publicly available traces are \textbf{non-interactive and/or outdated}.~\\~\\
        \item Previous work \textbf{hasn't looked at sports} in particular~\\~\\

\section{Analysis}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Methodology}

    % Briefly mention the stats, and re-state that we did this analysis to characterise the
    % interactive nature of the media, and to aid in simulating and creating new protocols.

    % Andy suggests we remove the amount of users

    \textbf{Results}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 66 matches (64 Worldcup matches, and 2 pre-competition friendlies)
        \item 13$^{th}$ June until 16$^{th}$ July 2006
        \item 405 unique users, average 30.7 users per game
    \end{itemize}~\\

    \textbf{Models}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Fitted models (where appropriate)
        \item Helps to understand the nature of the result
        \item Allows future simulations to use models

    % complete departure from previous results that show a roughly uniform popularity of the whole video
    % emphasises the need for segment caching,
    % Object popularity follows a simple normal distribution, Previously results have show a Zipf, however
    % we have small number of videos, and videos were generally only popular for a couple of days
