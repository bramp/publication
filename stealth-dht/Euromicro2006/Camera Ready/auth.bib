% "Security Considerations for Peer-to-Peer Distributed Hash Tables"
% - DHT papers generally don't consider malicious nodes
% - Routing attacks
%    - Incorrect lookup routing
%    - Incorrect routing updates
%    - Partitioning into incorrect networks
% - Storage attacks
%    - Denying storage/retrieval (solve through replication with multiple functions?)
% - Miscellaneous attacks
%    - Inconsistent behaviour (difficult to identify malicious nodes)
%    - Denial of service on targeted nodes
%    - Rapid churning to introduce overhead
