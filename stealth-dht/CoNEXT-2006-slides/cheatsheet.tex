Join Overhead: Messages (Simulation) - Fig 4
    Explain decrease compared to Pastry
    Stealth 95\% has ~ 95\% decrease in join messages
    Stealth 80\% has ~ 85\% decrease in join messages
    Stealth 50\% has ~ 55\% decrease in join messages
    Hiccup at the beginning due to the small network size

Join Overhead: Messages (PlanetLab) - Fig 13
    Similar to previous graph, but shows actual figures rather than relative
    Pastry 40-50 messages per join
    Stealth 50\% < 20 messages
    Stealth 95\% around 5 messages

Join Overhead: Latency (Simulation) - Fig5
    Compared to Pastry
    Stealth 95\% 10-15\% decrease
    Stealth 90\% ~5\% decrease
    Stealth 50\% minor decrease
    Hiccup at the beginning due to the small network size

Lookup: Latency with and without churn (Simulation) - Fig6
    4 lines, No Churn, Stealth Churn, Service Churn, Both Churning, compared to Pastry not churning
    When Service nodes don't churn, we can see up to 40\% decrease in lookup latency
    When they do churn, we see upto 20\% increase in lookup latency
    Hiccup at the beginning due to the churn rate and how a large fraction of the nodes in small networks have churned
    
Lookup: Misses under churn (Simulation) - Fig7
    Lookup with replication (with all churning)
    Stealth and Pastry with no replication has 40-60\% misses
    With replication Stealth and Pastry exhibit similar rates of misses (20\%)
    Numbers seem large due to high churn rate

Lookup: Misses under decreasing churn (Simulation) - Fig11
    Decreasing rates of churn
    High churn, no replication 75\% misses, some replication 45\% misses
    Low churn, no replication 50\% misses, some replication 15\% misses
    Tends to zero off the graph
    
Load balancing: No Churn (Simulation) - Fig8a
    Stealth show most nodes (ie the Stealth receive 5-20 messages), and Service nodes 30-1000 messages
    Pastry between 1 and 1000 messages

Load balancing: Churn (Simulation) - Fig8b
    Stealth nodes between 1 and 20, Service 30-1000 messages
    Pastry however goes to crap, non uniform load, with 30\% of nodes receiving >1000!
